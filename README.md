# Spring Music on Kubernetes with Digital Ocean PostgreSQL

This example shows how you can use `Porter` to create a CNAB bundle that will use `s3cmd` to first make a new Space on Digital Ocean, use `Terraform` to provision a PostgreSQL Database Cluster, and deploy [Spring Music]() to a Kubernetes cluster with `Helm`. When `Terraform` is run, it will use the Space created by `s3cmd` as a backend, in order to store the TF state file. When `Helm` is used to deploy Spring Music, it will use the database connection information generated by the `Terraform` apply! This example shows how multiple tools can be chained together to deploy a Cloud Native Application.

This repo also contains an example GitHub action configuration `.github/workflows/main.yml` that shows how you might use `Porter` to build and publish the CNAB bundle to a Docker Registry!

## Try it Out Yourself

### Prerequisites

In order to try this out yourself, you'll first need to install `Porter`. Please see the [installation](https://porter.sh/install/) instructions for the steps needed to do that. You'll need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) in order to use `Porter`, and you'll also need a Digital Ocean [account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new).

Once you have the account, you'll need to create an [access token](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/) and generate a [Spaces API Key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key).

You should set these as environment variables for use with the bundle. These values will look something like:

```
DO_SPACES_SECRET=bqPMB6k00MXkhOKucafebabea4LYphcnNCfOBL/+4tU
DO_SPACES_KEY=KIAGKdecafbadS5SSCRC
DO_ACCESS_KEY=16d225ebdecafbadcff2d05484c78ea8f81f38224940f3c4844c0cdd9996c75c
```

NOTE: You need the "secret" values for the Access Token and Spaces Secret, not the name.


Next, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster and a `kubeconfig` file. You can use [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/), any other Kubernetes cluster, as long as it can successfully create a service of type LoadBalancer.

### Install from the Tag

Porter allows you to work with local bundles, as well as with bundles that have been published to an OCI registry. If you'd like to try this bundle out without cloning the repository and building locally, follow these steps! If you'd like to experience building a bundle locally, try out the instructions for [building locally](#build-locally).

##### Generate a Credential

Once this has finished, you are almost ready to install the bundle. Before you install, however, you'll need to generate a credential. To do this, we'll use the `porter credentials generate` command:

```
porter credentials generate --tag jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle:v0.4.0
```

This will launch a guided dialog for building a credential. You'll see prompts like this:

```
Generating new credential spring-music from bundle spring-music
==> 4 credentials required for bundle spring-music
? How would you like to set credential "do_access_token"  [Use arrows to move, space to select, type to filter]
  specific value
> environment variable
  file path
  shell command
```

For the three digital ocean credentials, select `environment variable` and provide the corresponding value. For the `kubeconfig`, you should select `file path` and give the location of your config file:

```
? How would you like to set credential "kubeconfig"  [Use arrows to move, space to select, type to filter]
  specific value
  environment variable
> file path
  shell command
Enter the path that will be used to set credential "kubeconfig" $HOME/.kube/config
```

#### Install The Bundle

Now that you have build the bundle and generated a credential, you are ready to install the bundle. To do that, we'll use the `porter install` command. You'll need to pick a value for the `space_name` and `database_name` parameter.

```
porter install --tag jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle:v0.4.0 -c spring-music --param space_name=<SOME VALUE> --param database_name=<SOME VALUE>
```

Some other parameters that you can set are:

* region
* node_count
* namespace
* helm_release

### Build locally

#### Clone This Repo

The first thing you'll need to do in order to try the bundle out is to clone this repo and enter into that directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/jeremyrickard/do-porter.git
cd do-porter
```

#### Build The Bundle

Now, you are ready to build the bundle.

```
porter build
```

##### Generate a Credential

Once this has finished, you are almost ready to install the bundle. Before you install, however, you'll need to generate a credential. To do this, we'll use the `porter credentials generate` command:

```
porter credentials generate
```

This will launch a guided dialog for building a credential. You'll see prompts like this:

```
Generating new credential spring-music from bundle spring-music
==> 4 credentials required for bundle spring-music
? How would you like to set credential "do_access_token"  [Use arrows to move, space to select, type to filter]
  specific value
> environment variable
  file path
  shell command
```

For the three digital ocean credentials, select `environment variable` and provide the corresponding value. For the `kubeconfig`, you should select `file path` and give the location of your config file:

```
? How would you like to set credential "kubeconfig"  [Use arrows to move, space to select, type to filter]
  specific value
  environment variable
> file path
  shell command
Enter the path that will be used to set credential "kubeconfig" $HOME/.kube/config
```

#### Install The Bundle

Now that you have build the bundle and generated a credential, you are ready to install the bundle. To do that, we'll use the `porter install` command. You'll need to pick a value for the `space_name` and `database_name` parameter.


```
porter install -c spring-music --param space_name=<SOME VALUE> --param database_name=<SOME VALUE>
```

Some other parameters that you can set are:

* region
* node_count
* namespace
* helm_release


### Viewing the Output

Once the bundle has been successfully installed, you can use the `porter instances list` and `porter instances show` command to see your bundle installations.

First, view the instances that have been installed:

```
$ porter instances list
NAME           CREATED       MODIFIED      LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
spring-music   4 hours ago   3 hours ago   install       success
```

Then, use `porter instances show` to view more details:

```
$ porter instances show spring-music
Name: spring-music
Created: 4 hours ago
Modified: 3 hours ago
Last Action: install
Last Status: success

Outputs:
-----------------------------------------------
  Name        Type    Value (Path if sensitive)
-----------------------------------------------
  service_ip  string  13.68.174.214
```

NOTE: the value for `service_ip` will be different for your installation

You should be able then view the application by navigating to that IP address in a web browser.
